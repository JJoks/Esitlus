# Enterprise Open Source How-To

## Opening Slide
s: Twitter poll

* Using Open Source
* Contributing to Open Source
* Maintaining OSS projects

## Introduction
s: Doug Ireton
Working in IT since 1993 - 23 years, 22 years at large enterprise companies.

s: I now work 1Strategy, an AWS and DevOps consultancy helping companies move applications to the cloud.

s: This talk is based my time at Nordstrom where I was a Sr. Chef engineer as well as
the unofficial "Open Source Czar". I helped application teams navigate open source
licenses, shepherded the CCLAs for Facebook and Google through our contract review and
leadership approval, and helped teams successfully contribute to projects like Chef, Facebook's
React.JS, and Kubernetes.

## Disruption - Hook
s: Open source is disruptive

s: What do these companies have in common?
18f.gov - Government
Uber - Taxis
Simple - Banking
Gilt - Retail
New York Times - Newspapers
Tesla - Automobiles
Chef - Configuration Mgmt Software

They all disrupted large, stable industries
by using and contributing to open source technology

s: Disrupt or be disrupted
As an enterprise, you have the same choice.

## Why am I here?
When I started at Nordstrom in 2008, we didn't participate in OSS.
We didn't go to conferences, much less speak at conferences. With the exception
of Redhat Enterprise Linux, we certainly didn't use OSS.

Maybe you're in the same boat. Maybe you've started to contribute to OSS but you're
worried that Legal, or your Director will find out and shut the whole thing down.

Maybe you're a manager or director and you're worried someone will post
critical intellectual property on GitHub.

Whoever you are, I want to help you be successful. I believe that open source is the key to a dynamic
work environment where engineers do their best work.

Open source gives engineering teams control of their destiny. It allows them to move quickly
and fix things.

## Introduction
s: Move quickly
s: Control your destiny
s: Attract and retain top talent
s: Guidelines accelerate participation.

1. Using Open Source software allows you to move quickly.
2. Contributing to Open Source allows you to control your destiny.
3. Encouraging open source contributions helps you attract and retain top talent.
4. In an enterprise, guidelines help non-experts participate. Otherwise people are afraid.

# Using Open Source software allows you to move quickly.

## Enterprise Software vs Open Source
I have seen how open source has helped Nordstrom's app teams move faster - from
deploying every few months to deploying daily or weekly. Using new software no
longer means a three month negotiation process.

Also, most enterprise software is written to run on long running servers in a data
center. It's not designed to work with cloud infrastructure which may only last for minutes
or days.

When we moved to the cloud, open source software became the overwhelming default because
teams wanted to move quickly. Engineers who are empowered to stand up servers,
load balancers, and databases in minutes don't want to wait three months for
software license negotiations.

### BlackDuck - Why use open source?

2. Competitive features
3. Ability to customize and fix

# Contributing to Open Source allows you to control your destiny.

## BD - Contributing
* 65% of companies are contributing to OSS

## BD - Why companies participate in OSS

1. Fix bugs or add functionality
2. Gain competitive advantage
3. Reduce development costs


# Encouraging open source contributions helps you attract and retain top talent.

s: "I would be willing to work for a company which didn't allow open source contributions"

68% Disagreed
25% Neutral

Only 7% agreed

## Open Source Jobs Report - Dice/Linux Foundation
Hiring managers:
59% looking to increase open-source Hiring
87% say it's hard to find open source talent

Half of those surveyed were offered an incentive to keep them from switching jobs in the past year, while
73 percent were contacted by a recruiter at least once in the past six months. Eighty-six percent
believe their open source skills have advanced their careers


# In an enterprise, guidelines help non-experts participate. Otherwise people are afraid.


## Licenses
Apache 2.0

## Director approval for open sourcing internal projects

## Security Review
How are you going to review all those OSS cookbooks you are using?

## Create an Org
Fork repos into your Org to make it clear this is work-for-hire, not a personal project
This also helps your reputation
Your company's GitHub resume


## CCLAs not ICLAs please



# Summary
s:
Move quickly
Control your destiny
Attract and retain top talent
Guidelines accelerate participation.

1. Using Open Source software allows you to move quickly.
2. Contributing to Open Source allows you to control your destiny.
3. Encouraging open source contributions helps you attract and retain top talent.
4. In an enterprise, guidelines help non-experts participate. Otherwise people are afraid.


## Bigger idea:
why this concept matters to you even if it is irrelevant to your particular work

"Open source embodies a model for people to work together, building something greater than they can create on their own." - https://github.com/blog/2195-the-shape-of-open-source

## Internal Open Source
"In my recent article, Macro Trends in the Tech Industry, I wrote about the phenomenon that developers are communicating primarily through code, using tools such as GitHub. This allows increased efficiency and productivity, and is giving rise to “internal open source” within organizations looking to boost their output."
