This is an example module created for use with the session Demystifing Drupal Ajax Commands (in Drupal 8) for Drupal Midcamp 2016. (see the presentation here: http://bit.ly/Mid16Ajax)

If you would like to see a more complex example of using Ajax Callback Commands you can checkout my other example module: "Ajax dblog" at https://github.com/mikemiles86/ajax_dblog
