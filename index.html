					<h1>Predictability</h1>
					<h3>or Why JSX & Inline Styles Win Over 'Seperation of Concerns' Dogma</h3>

							<li>
								Who here shouted that at twitter when they first saw JSX?
							</li>
							<li>
								Perfect audience?
							</li>
							<li>
								Seperation of concerns is why we put js in one folder,
							</li>
							<li>
								styles in another,
							</li>
							<li>
								and markup in another.
							</li>
							<li>
								I think the main point of that was to get us to stop writing repetitive scripts & styles.
							</li>
							<li>
								Instead we started reusing the scripts & styles.
							</li>
							<li>
								That made our sites more DRY.
							</li>
							<li>
								Now that we write modular components, we don't have to use the different folders & files abstraction.
							</li>
							<li>
								Because reusable components are dry by nature.
							</li>
							<li>
								Let me tell you why I say that.

					<h2>Problem</h2>
					<p>
						It's difficult to predictably modify or style components in a <span class="fragment">React</span> web app.
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li class="fragment">
							Globals
						</li>
						<li class="fragment">
							Sharing Values Across 'Concerns'
						</li>
						<li class="fragment">
							The Cascade
						</li>

			    	 It's difficult to predictably modify or style components in a web app

			    	 Specifically a React app for the purposes of this presentation.

			    	 There are challenges surrounding: globals, sharing values across 'concerns', the cascade, dependencies, findability, and readability.

			    	 I'll go into each more indepth now.

						<h2>Globals</h2>
						<p>
							CSS Stylesheets Encourage Piles of Globals
						</p>
						<aside class="notes">
				      We all know that littering our app with globals in JS is a dangerous thing, but for some reason we think it's ok with CSS.
				    </aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Bootstrap, for Instance, Introduces 600 Globals</h2>
						<br>
						<p>
							<small>Shamelessly stolen from <a href="http://blog.vjeux.com/2014/javascript/react-css-in-js-nationjs.html">Christopher Chedeau's presentation on inline styles</a>.</small>
						</p>
						<aside class="notes">
				    	Each declaration is essentially a global variable being placed in the browser waiting for an element to grab it.

				    	How many of you used to write JS this way?

				    	How many still do?
				    </aside>
					</section>
				</section>

				<section>
					<section>
						<h2>Sharing Values</h2>
						<p>
							Comment breadcrumbs are a pretty shoddy way of telling your future self where shared values are.
						</p>
						<p class="fragment">
							What if filenames change?
						</p>
						<p class="fragment">
							Or if some jerk doesn't update the comment when they move the shared code.
						</p>
						<aside class="notes">
				      There are times when you need to derive a value in js that will also be used in css.

				      If you're strategy here is to assign the value in each and leave a comment saying where it needs to be kept in sync, you've created an unpredictable brittle link for future you, or the next dev to hopefully respect.
				    </aside>
					</section>
				</section>

				<section>
					<section>
						<h2>The Cascade</h2>
						<p>
							It's essentially a giant extend.
						</p>
						<aside class="notes">
				      Extends are great. We use them all the time in js. But if you have to mentally keep track of several extendedrules in your head, you'll probably fail.
				    </aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>
							Extend is great in moderation,...
						</p>
						<p class="fragment">
							But when you've got hundreds of rules overriding each each other you need to introduce complex naming conventions <span class="fragment">(BEM)</span> to manage them.
						</p>
						<aside class="notes">
				      Order of declaration is a pretty simple rule to follow, but when you're looking at thousands of lines, it's impossible to keep it in order in your head.

				      Standards like BEM are pretty great for combating this problem, but it feels like a pretty sloppy solution.

						<h2>Dependencies</h2>
						<p>Serving async CSS is a potential nightmare.</p>
						<aside class="notes">
				      You may want to only serve styles for what's on a page in a large Single Page App.

				      You could produce real performance gains this way.
				    </aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Async + The Cascade === Race Conditions</h2>
						<p class="fragment">
							That can span entire site visits.
						</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>
							If someone get's to your app from a page other than home, then goes home, what order do the CSS files from each visit get processed in?
						</p>
						<p class="fragment">
							How do you debug/QA test for that?
						</p>
						<aside class="notes">
				      I don't know of a great solution for this, but I also haven't encountered this problem.
				    </aside>
					</section>
				</section>

				<section>
					<section>
						<h2>Findability</h2>
						<p>
							It's simple to find things in your app, and you already have your own methods to handle it.
						</p>
						<aside class="notes">
				      This probably seems dumb because you've been dealing with this issue for so long you don't even notice it.
				    </aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>One way</h2>
						<p class="fragment">(of many)</p>
						<ol>
							<li class="fragment">
								You look at a component in your browser to find identifiable text.
							</li>
							<li class="fragment">
								Then you grep for that phrase in your templates.
							</li>
							<li class="fragment">
								Then you grep in your view folder for a call for that previously found template file.
							</li>
							<li class="fragment">
								And you can grep your style folder for all uses of any relevant classes from the template file.
							</li>
							<li class="fragment">
								Then you look at each declaration to determine if it's specificity score qualifies for an override.
							</li>
						</ol>
						<p class="fragment">
							Simple!

						<h2>Readability</h2>
						<p>JSX in JS looks like the apocalypse to most seperation of concerns dogmatists.</p>
				    <pre><code data-trim class="jsx">
const {
  reportName,
  filters,
} = state

if (!props.isOpen) return (<span></span>)

return (
  <Modal
    title='Reporting Chart Configuration'
    backdrop={true}
    animation={true}
    container={props.container}
    onRequestHide={props.hideHandler}
    ref='reportSelectModal'
  >
    <div className='modal-body'>
      <div className='control-group'>
        <label>Source</label>
			</div>
		</div>
	</Modal>
)
				    </code></pre>
						<aside class="notes">
				      Most of us probably scoffed pretty hard when we first saw JSX.

				      I know I did.

						<h2>XML in JS?</h2>
						<p>Wat? Why???</p>
						<aside class="notes">
				      This goes against everything we've ever be taught,... right?
				    </aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Nested Function Calls</h2>
						<p>
							A series of nested function calls describing the DOM end up looking like a JS pyramid.
						</p>
				    <pre><code data-trim class="es6">
function render() {
	return React.createElement(
		MyComponent,
		null,
		React.createElement(
			"h1",
			null,
			"Hello World"
		)
	)
}
				    </code></pre>
						<aside class="notes">
				      The alternative isn't terribly readable though.
				    </aside>

					<h2>We've Gotten Pretty Good at All of That</h2>
					<p class="fragment">
						But there's a better way.
					</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<section>
						<h2>JSX</h2>
						<p>
							JSX is actually an XML like veneer that get's preprocessed into the function calls we're trying to avoid.
						</p>
						<aside class="notes">
				      JSX is the part of a react component that looks like someone just dumped XML in the middle of our beatiful work.
				    </aside>
					</section>
					<section>
					  <pre><code data-trim class="jsx">
render () {
	return (
		<MyComponent>
			<h1>Hello World</h1>
		</MyComponent>
	)
}
					  </code></pre>
					  <div class="fragment">
							<p>is sugar for</p>

	function render() {
		return React.createElement(
			MyComponent,

				"Hello World"
			)

						<h2>Inline Styles</h2>
						<p>
							We all know how to write inline styles. You just add a style attribute to an HTML element.
						</p>
						<p class="fragment">
							That declaration automatically takes precedence.
						</p>
						<aside class="notes">
				      This is an old, and frowned upon concept.
				    </aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Inline Styles in React</h2>
						<p>
							React encourages the use of inline styles by providing a parser which reads JS objects that have a very similar syntax to CSS.
						</p>
						<p class="fragment">
							The differences are:
							<ul>
								<li class="fragment">
									Keys are camelCased instead of dashed
								    <pre><code data-trim class="es6">
{ font-weight: 700; } => { fontWeight: 700 }
								    </code></pre>
								</li>
								<li class="fragment">
									Values are quoted
								    <pre><code data-trim class="es6">
{ color: #F00; } => { color: '#F00' }
								    </code></pre>
								</li>
								<li class="fragment">
									And single pixel values are numbers without the PX
								    <pre><code data-trim class="es6">
{ height: 175px; } => { height: 175 }
								    </code></pre>
								</li>
							</ul>
						</p>
						<aside class="notes">
				      React has cleaned up this concept and brought it back to life.

				      There are subtle differences between React's Styles and CSS's.

							Keys are camelCased instead of dashed

							Values are quoted

							And single pixel values are numbers without the PX

						<aside class="notes">
				      I'm assuming everyone here is familiar with the CommonJS pattern of requiring in modules.

				      Well, styles written in JS can freely be pulled in in the same way.
