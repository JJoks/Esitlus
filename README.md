This is `grunt-init` project template to create beautiful presentations using HTML with [reveal.js][].


## Installation
If you haven't already done so, install [grunt-init][].

Once grunt-init is installed, place this template in your `~/.grunt-init/` directory. It's recommended that you use git to clone this template into that directory, as follows:

```
git clone git@github.com:toonketels/grunt-init-reveal.git -b grunt-init ~/.grunt-init/reveal
```

Note we currently need to `grunt-init` branch.

_(Windows users, see [the documentation][grunt-init] for the correct destination directory path)_

## Usage

At the command-line, cd into an empty directory, run this command and follow the prompts.

```
grunt-init reveal
```

_Note that this template will generate files in the current directory, so be sure to change to a new directory first if you don't want to overwrite existing files._

Install dependencies with npm.

```
npm install
```
